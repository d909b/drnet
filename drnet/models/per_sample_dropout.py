class PerSampleDropout(Layer):
    """Applies Dropout to the input.

    Dropout consists in randomly setting
    a fraction `rate` of input units to 0 at each update during training time,
    which helps prevent overfitting.

    # Arguments
        rate: float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
        noise_shape: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the
            binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
            For instance, if your inputs have shape
            `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` and
            you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
            you can use `noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features)`.
        seed: A Python integer to use as random seed.
