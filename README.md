## Learning Counterfactual Representations for Estimating Individual Dose-Response Curves

![DRNet](http://schwabpatrick.com/img/drnet.png)

Dose response networks (DRNets) are a method for learning to estimate individual dose-response curves for multiple parametric treatments from observational data using neural networks. This repository contains the source code used to evaluate DRNets and the most relevant existing state-of-the-art methods for estimating individual treatment effects (for results please see [our manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00981)). In order to facilitate future research, the source code is designed to be easily extensible with (1) new methods and (2) new benchmark datasets.

#### Usage:

- Runnable scripts are in the `drnet/apps/` subdirectory.
    - `drnet/apps/main.py` is the main runnable script for running experiments.
    - The available command line parameters for runnable scripts are described in `drnet/apps/parameters.py`
- You can add new baseline methods to the evaluation by subclassing `drnet/models/baselines/baseline.py`
    - See e.g. `drnet/models/baselines/neural_network.py` for an example of how to implement your own baseline methods.
    - You can register new methods for use from the command line by adding a new entry to the `get_method_name_map` method in `drnet/apps/main.py`
- You can add new benchmarks by implementing the benchmark interface, see e.g. `drnet/models/benchmarks` for examples of how to add your own benchmark to the benchmark suite.
    - You can register new benchmarks for use from the command line by adding a new entry to the `get_benchmark_name_map` method in `drnet/apps/evaluate.py`

#### Requirements and dependencies

- This project was designed for use with Python 2.7. We can not guarantee and have not tested compatibility with Python 3.

- To run the TCGA and News benchmarks, you need to download the SQLite databases containing the raw data samples for these benchmarks (`news.db` and `tcga.db`).
    - You can download the raw data using these links: [tcga.db](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/OrwKOXHToZfxVyE) and [news.db](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/fRQZREF528AfD5Z).
        - Note that you need around 10GB of free disk space to store the databases.
    - Save the database files to the `./data` directory relative to this file in order to be compatible with the step-by-step guides below or adjust the commands accordingly.
- To run the MVICU benchmark, you need to get access to the [MIMIC-III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/) which requires going through an [approval process](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/), due to the sensitive nature of the dataset.
    - Note that you need around 75GB of free disk space to store the MIMIC-III database with indices.
    - Once you have access to the dataset and loaded the MIMIC-III data into an SQLite database (saved as e.g. `/your/path/to/mimic3.db`), you can use the `drnet/apps/load_db_icu.py` script to extract the MVICU benchmark data from the MIMIC-III database into a separate database in the `./data` folder by running:
        - `python drnet/apps/load_db_icu.py /your/path/to/mimic3.db ./data`
        - Once built, the benchmark database uses around 43MB of disk space.
- To run BART, Causal Forests and GPS, and to reproduce the figures you need to have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed. See https://www.r-project.org/ for installation instructions.
    - To run BART, you need to have the R-packages `rJava` and `bartMachine` installed. See https://github.com/kapelner/bartMachine for installation instructions. Note that `rJava` requires a working Java installation as well.
    - To run Causal Forests, you need to have the R-package `grf` installed. See https://github.com/grf-labs/grf for installation instructions.
    - To run GPS, you need to have the R-package `causaldrf` installed, e.g. by running `install.packages("causaldrf")` in your R-shell.
    - To reproduce the paper's figures, you need to have the R-package `latex2exp` installed. See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/latex2exp/vignettes/using-latex2exp.html for installation instructions.
- For the python dependencies, see `setup.py`. You can use `pip install .` to install the drnet package and its python dependencies. Note that the installation of `rpy2` will fail if you do not have a working R installation on your system (see above).

#### Reproducing the experiments

- Make sure you have the necessary requirements listed above, including a `./data` directory relative to this file with the required databases (see above).
- You can use the script `drnet/apps/run_all_experiments.py` to obtain the exact parameters used with `main.py` to reproduce the experimental results in the paper.
    - The `drnet/apps/run_all_experiments.py` script prints the command line parameters that have to be executed to reproduce the experiments, one command per line.
    - The `drnet/apps/run_all_experiments.py` script only prints the command line parameters - they are not executed automatically. You must execute them manually using your compute platform of choice. You can test individual commands by pasting them into the console.
        - The time required to complete a single command can range from an hour to multiple days of CPU time, depending on the model being evaluated.
        - Note that we ran hundreds of experiments using multiple CPU months of computation time. We therefore suggest to run the commands in parallel using, e.g., a compute cluster.
        - The original experiments reported in our paper were run on Intel CPUs. We found that running the experiments on GPUs can produce slightly different results for the same experiments.
- Once you have completed the experiments, you can calculate the summary statistics (mean +- standard deviation) over all the repeated runs using the `./run_results.sh` script. The results are reported in LaTeX syntax in the order reported in the results tables, i.e. `{12.2} $\pm$ 0.1 & {14.3} $\pm$ 0.2 & {32.8} $\pm$ 0.0` where 12.2, 14.3 and 32.8 are the means of MISE, DPE and PE and 0.1, 0.2, and 0.0 are the standard deviations of MISE, DPE and PE, respectively.
    - See the step-by-step instructions below to reproduce each reported result.
    - If the `./run_results.sh` script produces errors, one or multiple of your runs may have failed to complete successfully. You can check the run's `run.txt` file to see whether there have been any errors.
- You can reproduce the figures in our manuscript using the R-scripts in `drnet/visualisation/`.

##### News-2/News-4/News-8/News-16

- Navigate to the directory containing this file.
- Create a folder to hold the experimental results `mkdir -p results`.
- Run `python ./drnet/apps/run_all_experiments.py ./drnet/apps news ./data ./results`
    - The script will print all the command line configurations (260 in total) you need to run to obtain the experimental results to reproduce the News results.
- Run all of the printed command line configurations from the previous step in a compute environment of your choice.
- After the experiments have concluded, use `./run_results.sh` to calculate the summary metrics over the repeated runs in LaTeX syntax.
    - Use `./run_results.sh ./results/drnet_news2a10k_{METHOD_NAME}_mse_1`, where {METHOD_NAME} should be replaced with the shorthand code of the method for which you wish to read out the result metrics.
